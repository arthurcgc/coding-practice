# Reminder / Pseudocode
```
Given an array nums,

prefix = [nums[0]]
for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++)
    prefix.append(nums[i] + prefix[prefix.length - 1])
```

## Why
Building a prefix sum is a form of pre-processing. Pre-processing is a useful strategy in a variety of problems where we store pre-computed data in a data structure before running the main logic of our algorithm. While it takes some time to pre-process, it's an investment that will save us a huge amount of time during the main parts of the algorithm.
