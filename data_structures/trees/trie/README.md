# Trie (Prefix Tree)

A Trie, also known as a Prefix Tree, is a tree-based data structure used for efficient string searching and storage. It is particularly useful when dealing with problems that involve searching for strings with common prefixes. The Trie data structure organizes strings in a way that allows for fast retrieval and prefix-based operations.

## Use Cases

- Autocomplete and predictive text: Tries can be used to efficiently suggest completions or predict the next word based on the user's input.
- Spell checking: Tries can be used to quickly check if a given word is spelled correctly by searching for it in the Trie.
- IP routing: Tries can be used to store and search for IP addresses efficiently, making them suitable for routing and network applications.
- Word games: Tries can be used to store a dictionary of valid words and quickly check if a given word exists in the dictionary.
- Longest common prefix: Tries can be used to find the longest common prefix among a set of strings efficiently.

Overall, Tries are a powerful data structure for solving problems that involve efficient string searching and storage, especially when dealing with common prefixes.
